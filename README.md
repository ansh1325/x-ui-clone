This project is a **frontend clone of Twitter’s interface**, built using **HTML** and **Tailwind CSS**.  
It replicates the Twitter homepage layout with a sidebar, main feed, and right panel (“What’s happening” and “Who to follow”).  
I built this to practice **responsive design** and **Tailwind CSS** utility classes.
